# Voice-Controlled-DC-MOTOR-CAR

The purpose of this project was to learn the use of a microcontroller (89c51) in practical application. This will be demonstrated by controlling the movement of an electrical car through voice commands. These commands will be sent in the form of strings through an android app, specifically made for this project, using Bluetooth communication. The commands will then be received by the Bluetooth module HC-05 which will then be transmitted to the microprocessor through serial communication. The processor, using an algorithm written in C, will then make decisions based on the data it receives, and will set its output ports to either high or low based on which direction the motor is to be rotated. This in turn will drive the car.


The code and details are shared in the word file.
